Located to the south of Kalbarri, near the mouth of the Hutt River, Port Gregory is a scenic fishing village encircled by 5km of exposed coral reef. Originally developed to serve the Geraldine mine, the town is now a holiday destination for fishing and diving. Port Gregory is the home of the Pink Lake called Hutt Lagoon. It boasts a pink hue created by presence of carotenoid-producing algae Dunaliella salina, a source of ß-carotene, a food-colouring agent and source of vitamin A.⁣

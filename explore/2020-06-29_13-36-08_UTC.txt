The Allgäu is a mountainous region in Bavaria, southern Germany. It’s known for its castles, like the 19th-century fairy-tale Neuschwanstein Castle, built for King Ludwig II, and the nearby Hohenschwangau Castle. The ruins of the centuries-old Eisenberg and Hohenfreyberg castles have mountain views. In the town of Füssen, the Monastery of St. Mang houses the Füssen Heritage Museum and the baroque Prince’s Hall.⁣

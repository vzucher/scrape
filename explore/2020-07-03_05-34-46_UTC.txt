In an idyllic setting among rocks and pine trees, the Illa Roja beach is known for its clear waters and the prominent reddish rocky island that presides over it, giving it its name ('Red Island'). It's a quiet, uncrowded spot with coarse golden sand and a pronounced slope heading down to the sea – and it's a nudist beach with international prestige, so it draws its share of foreign tourists. The only way there is via a lovely path along the coast, which, together with the wild environs and ravines surrounding it, contribute to its reputation as a small, hidden oasis tucked away in the wilderness.⁣

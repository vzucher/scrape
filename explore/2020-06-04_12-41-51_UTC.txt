The Agafay desert is located thirty kilometers in the South of Marrakech and extends over several hundred acres. This rocky desert, can be likened to a sand desert. Indeed, its white dunes stand and landscape are similar to the Sahara dunes. In the middle of the desert, is a surprising oasis, a haven of peace and tranquility, where the fauna and flora can easily develop. In this paradise, frogs and turtles live peacefully in the oueds, surrounded by water and rocks. Lost in the dunes are still some Berber villages that continue to exist in this austere but sublime nature.⁣

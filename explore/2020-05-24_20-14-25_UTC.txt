If you’re looking to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city or want to take a breather from everyday life, Policeman’s Creek is the perfect place for you.The creek is quiet, hidden, relatively undisturbed — and that’s what makes this place beautiful. It can feel like you’ve escaped the city as soon as you step onto the boardwalk.⁣

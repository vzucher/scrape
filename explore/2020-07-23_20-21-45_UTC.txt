The name Alaska comes from the Aleut word Alyeska, meaning The Great Land. Benny Benson designed Alaska’s flag in 1926 at age 13. It would become the official state flag upon Alaska’s adoption into the Union in 1959. The state bird of Alaska is the willow ptarmigan and the state sport is dog mushing, which was once the primary mode of transportation in most of Alaska. The Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race is the state’s largest sporting event.⁣

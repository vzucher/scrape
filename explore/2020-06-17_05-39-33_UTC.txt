Located in the Kintamani region northeast on the island at an altitude of 1300 meters above sea level, Pinggan Village is a unique sight. Or the village itself isn’t that special but what happens almost every day during sunrise definitely is. If you are an avid photographer or just need a place to shoot photos for a special occasion like a wedding, Pinggan Village is the perfect place. As the sun rises the sky turns orange/pink and the thick blanket of mist slowly dissolves revealing a quaint little village ready to start the day. It’s so stunning you won’t believe your own eyes!⁣
